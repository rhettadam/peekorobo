Said points are worth 5 more during the Autonomous period, and one goal will be lit up during each half. That goal is worth 5 additional points, for a maximum total of a 10-point bonus. When Tele-op starts, a human player transfers a ball onto the playing field. The robots can then do either the basic goal score, or assist them in doing so.
