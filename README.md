## ACE (Adjusted Contribution Estimate) Algorithm

The core of Peekorobo's statistical analysis is the ACE model. It aims to provide a more robust measure of a team's expected contribution to a match by incorporating factors beyond just raw scoring potential.

The RAW model is an incremental update system, similar to Elo rating systems, where a team's RAW contribution changes after each match based on the difference between their actual contribution and their expected contribution. ACE refines this by introducing a Confidence score.

### Core Model

RAW updates are done incrementally after each match. Auto, Teleop, and Endgame are computed per match, and each component RAW output is nudged toward the observed value using a constant learning rate scaled by match importance. The first observed match initializes the component RAW outputs to the observed values.

```
# For each component c ∈ {auto, teleop, endgame}
delta_c = K * importance[comp_level] * (actual_c - raw_c)
K = 0.4
importance = {"qm": 1.1, "qf": 1.0, "sf": 1.0, "f": 1.0}

# Overall RAW is the sum of component RAW outputs after the update
overall_raw = auto_raw + teleop_raw + endgame_raw
```

No separate time-decay or championship penalties are applied in the current implementation.

### Component Estimation

- **Modern seasons (with `score_breakdown`)**: Component values are derived via year-specific scoring functions (from `data/yearmodels.py`). Auto and Teleop are computed from the match breakdowns; Endgame uses either the alliance breakdown or team index depending on the year’s scoring model. Opponent strength is normalized on a per-team basis to build a margin signal.
- **Legacy seasons (≤ 2014, no `score_breakdown`)**: Falls back to alliance score, scaled by alliance size using a logarithmic factor to approximate per-team contribution. This path also computes a normalized margin versus the opponent alliance.

### Confidence Calculation

ACE is defined as Season/Event Overall × Confidence. Confidence blends stability, competitive dominance, record alignment, veteran status, and event count, with a mild non-linear scaling at extremes.

```
# Weights (from implementation)
weights = {
  "consistency": 0.35,
  "dominance": 0.35,
  "record_alignment": 0.10,
  "veteran": 0.10,
  "events": 0.10,
}

# Components
consistency = 1 - stdev(contributions) / max(contributions)
dominance = mean(normalized_margins)
# Record alignment from W/L only (ties excluded):
#  win_rate = wins / (wins + losses)
record_alignment = 0.7 + 0.3 * win_rate   # ∈ [0.7, 1.0]

# Veteran boost from years of participation up to the given year
#   years ≤ 1 → 0.2, 2 → 0.4, 3 → 0.6, ≥4 → 1.0
veteran_boost ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0}

# Event boost from number of events in-season
#   1 event → 0.5, 2 events → 0.9, ≥3 events → 1.0
event_boost ∈ {0.5, 0.9, 1.0}

raw_confidence = Σ weights[k] * component_k

# Non-linear scaling (soften extremes)
if raw_confidence > 0.85:  raw_confidence = 0.85 + 1.1 * (raw_confidence - 0.85)
elif raw_confidence < 0.65: raw_confidence = 0.90 * raw_confidence
confidence = clamp(raw_confidence, 0.0, 1.0)

# Final ACE (a.k.a. displayed season/event contribution)
ACE = overall_raw * confidence
```

Wins/losses are determined directly from alliance scores; matches with a 0 score on either side are treated as ties. (2015 is handled with score-only logic.)

### Season Aggregation & Weighting

When aggregating across multiple events, contributions are weighted by both event timing and match volume:

```
effective_weight(event) = chronological_weight(event_date) * match_count(event)

# chronological_weight (piecewise over the regular season)
preseason  → ≈ 0.05
offseason  → ≈ 0.10
early      → 0.20 → 0.40
midseason  → 0.40 → 0.80
late       → 0.80 → 1.00
```

All component averages, margins, and confidence contributors use these weights. The same non-linear confidence scaling is applied after aggregation.

### Key Components

Each confidence component measures a different aspect of team performance:

*   **Consistency (35%)**: Stability of per-match contributions relative to peak performance. \( \text{Consistency} = 1 - \frac{\text{stdev}}{\text{peak}} \)
*   **Dominance (35%)**: Mean of normalized margins versus the opposing alliance, per team.
*   **Record Alignment (10%)**: Alignment of actual win rate to a simple record-based target. \(0.7 + 0.3\times\text{win\_rate}\)
*   **Veteran Status (10%)**: Experience-based boost: ≤1y 0.2, 2y 0.4, 3y 0.6, ≥4y 1.0.
*   **Event Count (10%)**: More events increase reliability: 1→0.5, 2→0.9, ≥3→1.0.
*   **Base Confidence (5%)**: Provides a minimum confidence floor to prevent extreme penalties from other factors.
