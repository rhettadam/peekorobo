## ACE (Adjusted Contribution Estimate) Algorithm

The core of Peekorobo's statistical analysis is the ACE model, which builds upon the traditional EPA (Estimated Points Added) concept. It aims to provide a more robust measure of a team's expected contribution to a match by incorporating factors beyond just raw scoring potential.

The EPA model is an incremental update system, similar to Elo rating systems, where a team's EPA changes after each match based on the difference between their actual contribution and their expected contribution. ACE refines this by introducing a Confidence score.

### Core Model

EPA updates are done incrementally after each match. Auto, Teleop, and Endgame contributions are calculated separately, then EPA is updated using a weighted delta with decay.

```
# For each component (auto, teleop, endgame):
delta = decay * K * (actual - epa)

# Where:
decay = world_champ_penalty * (match_count / total_matches)Â²
K = 0.4 * match_importance * world_champ_penalty

# World Championship penalties:
Einstein: 0.95
Division: 0.85
Regular: 1.0

# Match importance weights:
importance = {"qm": 1.1, "qf": 1.0, "sf": 1.0, "f": 1.0}
```

The decay factor ensures that recent matches have a stronger influence on EPA updates. The square of the `match_count / total_matches` term accelerates this decay as a team plays more matches. World Championship penalties slightly dampen the impact of matches at those high-level events. The `K` factor is a constant learning rate, adjusted by match importance (Quals are slightly more weighted to reduce alliance bias introduced in playoffs).

### Component Estimation

Each component (Auto, Teleop, Endgame) score for a match is estimated separately from the score breakdown data. To mitigate the impact of outlier "hot" matches or anomalies, an adaptive trimming method is applied to the history of a team's component scores.

```
# Trimming percentages based on match count:
< 12 matches: 0%
< 25 matches: 3%
< 40 matches: 5%
< 60 matches: 8%
< 100 matches: 10%
â¥ 100 matches: 12%

# Trim from low end only:
trimmed_scores = sorted(scores)[k:]  # k = n * trim_pct
```

This method trims a percentage of the lowest scores from the team's history, with the percentage increasing with the number of matches played. This provides a more stable estimate of a team's consistent performance for that component.

### Confidence Calculation

ACE = EPA Ã Confidence. The Confidence score is a weighted average of several components designed to measure the reliability and context of a team's performance.

```
weights = {
    "consistency": 0.4,
    "dominance": 0.25,
    "record_alignment": 0.15,
    "veteran": 0.1,
    "events": 0.05,
    "base": 0.05
}

# Components:
consistency = 1 - (stdev / peak_score)
dominance = mean(normalized_margin_scores)
record_alignment = 1 - |expected_win_rate - actual_win_rate|
veteran_bonus = 1.0 if veteran else 0.6
event_boost = 1.0 if events â¥ 2 else 0.60

confidence = min(1.0, sum(weight * component))
```

The raw confidence score is a sum of weighted component scores, capped at 1.0.

### Key Components

Each confidence component measures a different aspect of team performance:

*   **Consistency (40%)**: Measures stability of match-to-match performance. Higher when scores are more consistent relative to peak performance. \( \text{Consistency} = 1 - \frac{\text{standard deviation of scores}}{\text{peak score}} \)
*   **Dominance (25%)**: Measures how much a team outperforms opponents. Calculated from the mean of normalized margin scores across matches.
*   **Record Alignment (15%)**: How well the actual win rate matches the expected win rate derived from dominance scores. \( \text{Record Alignment} = 1 - |\text{expected win rate} - \text{actual win rate}| \)
*   **Veteran Status (10%)**: Veteran teams start with higher confidence (1.0 vs 0.6 for rookies) due to historical predictability.
*   **Event Count (5%)**: Teams participating in two or more events receive a confidence boost (1.0 vs 0.6).
*   **Base Confidence (5%)**: Provides a minimum confidence floor to prevent extreme penalties from other factors.
